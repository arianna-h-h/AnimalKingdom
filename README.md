# AnimalKingdom

This was a final project for an Android Development class at Austin Community College. 

The assignment specifications were to create an Android App using what we had learned during the semester. 
I chose to make a fun app that shows pictures of animals and plays the sound they make. 

The app uses TitleActivity.java as a start screen. The user navigates into MainActivity.java by pressing a button on the start screen. 
Once in the MainActivity.class, the user navigates between animals using a left Navigation Drawer. Once an animal is selected, the sound of the animal plays and a picture of the animal is displayed. This is accomplished by extending the Fragment class (AnimalFragment.java) and changing the fragment that is displayed when the user selects an item in the Navigation Drawer.
